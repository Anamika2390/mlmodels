# [Machine Learning Models](https://lexionbear.github.io/mlmodels/)

## A Collection Of State-of-Art Opensourced Machine Learning Models

We believe a structured descriptions of each algorithm is sufficent for most machine learning enthusiasts, free from deciphering papers.

## Pre-trained Models and Sample Code in Tensorflow

We go extra-miles to collect model files and sample codes, and making them available for free, just like their original authors.
